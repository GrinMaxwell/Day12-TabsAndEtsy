# Tabbed Interface and Functional Etsy Items

## Tabbed Interface

### Assignment: Build a tabbed interface where clicking a tab changes viewable contents
 - I had a lot of fun styling the tabs on this one. I made the `<a>`s for the hashchange inside `<div>`s with background gifs, so that when you hover over the `<a>` it becomes slowly translucent and reveals the gif beneath

## Functional Etsy Items

### Assignment: Create a website using array methods to answer questions

2. issues:
  - I had some difficulty using reduce to actually produce the single value I wanted for number 3 (the title of the item that has its price in pounds) so I just used filter instead
  - I want to play more with reduce to get used to it. A Youtuber I like (Mattias Petter Johansson of funfunfunction) says it's the most flexible and useful of the higher-order functions (see here: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl98eZpkp-c&index=3&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84`) but I have a harder time getting it to do what I want than .map or .filter. I think it has something to do with the extra parameters in the callback function, if I'm understanding that correctly. I'll have to play with it some more
